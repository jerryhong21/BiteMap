# Food Finder

## Project Overview
Food Finder is a web application developed by Jerry Hong (@jerry_hong21) in January 2024. Leveraging the Yelp developer API, it enables users to effortlessly search for restaurants based on their preferred categories, locations, and sorting options. The website is designed with a simplicity-driven approach, offering clear visuals and an intuitive user interface for an enhanced user experience.

## Features
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for restaurants by category and location.
- **Sorting Options**: Results can be sorted based on various criteria to meet user preferences.

## Project Status
*Inactive* - The website is currently inactive, with plans to introduce additional features, including:
- Making addresses clickable to open in Google Maps in a new tab.
- Enabling clickable images to redirect to the business' website in a new tab.
- Automatic re-querying of the Yelp API upon selecting a different sorting option, eliminating the need to click "Letâ€™s Go" again.
- Adding autocompletion for addresses in the "Location" input field.

## Planned Features
- [ ] Clickable addresses linking to Google Maps
- [ ] Clickable images linking to business websites
- [ ] Auto-re-querying upon sorting option change
